# The Nature of Code Exercises

This repository is me working through [The Nature Of Code](https://natureofcode.com/).  I am trying to complete *all*
of the exercises presented by the author by creating simple pages with the problem, my working solution, and a brief
overview of how I came to my solution.  There is no guarantee the examples are correct, for all I know they are way
off.

I am doing this to learn [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
