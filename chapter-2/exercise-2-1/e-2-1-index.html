    <h1>Exercise 2.1</h1>
    <p>
        Using forces, simulate a helium-filled balloon floating upward and bouncing off the top of
        a window. Can you add a wind force that changes over time, perhaps according to Perlin
        noise?
    </p>

    <div id="canvas"></div>
    <p>
        HOLD the mouse to apply a wind force.
    </p>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>
        I struggled with this one, partially due to not understanding P5 very well. I looked at the author's solution
        to see where I was going wrong and I'll explain what my mistake was at the end.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted this to be based off of reality so
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The canvas is a room with walls and cieling.</li>
        <li>The bottom of the canvas is the ground and the top is a cieling.</li>
        <li>The balloon needs to float slowly from the ground to the cieling but not past the cieling.</li>
        <li>The balloon should bounce once it hits the cieling, then float up again.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Started off with a <code>Balloon</code> class with vectors <code>location</code>, <code>velocity</code>, and
        <code>acceleration</code>. I also added the maximim velocity the balloon an rise and set it to 2. There is no
        reason for that, I just liked that speed. I also added methods <code>applyForce(force)</code> to apply an
        external force to the balloon, <code>checkEdges()</code> to determine when the balloon hits the sides and top of
        the room, <code>update()</code> to apply the forces onto the balloon, and <code>display()</code> to draw the
        balloon on the screen. The balloon starts at the bottom of the floor in the middle of the room. The
        <code>display()</code> method is the same as last few examples, an ellipse.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">class Balloon {
  constructor() {
    this.location = createVector(width / 2, height);
    this.velocity = createVector(0, 0);
    this.acceleration = createVector(0, 0)

    this.maxRiseVelocity = 2;
  }

  applyForce(force) {
  }

  checkEdges() {
  }

  update() {
  }

  display() {
    stroke(0);
    fill(175);
    ellipse(this.location.x, this.location.y, 16, 16);
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        The <code>applyForce(force)</code> method takes a Vector as a parameter and adds it to the
        <code>acceleration</code>, <em>it does not apply it to the velocity or location</em>.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">applyForce(force) {
  this.acceleration.add(force);
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        The <code>update()</code> method follows the rule set by the author: acceleration updates velocity and velocity
        updates the location. The important thing is to reset <code>acceleration</code> after the updates otherwise
        the next time a force is applied the forces compound. By resetting the acceleration the behavior is much like
        a push.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">update() {
  this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
  this.velocity.limit(this.maxRiseVelocity);
  this.location.add(this.velocity);

  this.acceleration.mult(0);
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Checking edges is where the bouncing behavior occurrs. Checking the cieling hit, if <code>location.y</code> is
        <em>less than</em> 0, the balloon has hit the cieling. The <code>location.y</code> is set to 0, and
        <code>velocity.y</code> is reversed. Reversing the velocity is what simulates the "bounce." However, this
        will make the balloon float back down towards the floor at the same speed at which it hit the cieling, which is
        not realistic. I divide <code>velocity</code> by 2 to make it more realistic. There is no logic why 2, it
        just looks believable. When checkign for hitting the walls, if <code>location.x</code> is less than 0, the
        balloon has hit the left wall and needs to bounce back. If <code>location.x</code> is greater than
        <code>width</code>, the balloon has hit the right wall and needs to bounce back. In both cases, it's enough to
        reverse <code>velocity</code>, it still behaves realistically. On both sides of the wall, the
        <code>location.x</code> value is set to either 0 or <code>width</code> to keep the balloon from going off the
        canvas.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">checkEdges() {
  if (this.location.y &lt; 0) {
    this.location.y = 0;
    this.velocity.y *= -1;
    this.velocity.div(2);
  }

  if (this.location.x &lt; 0) {
    this.location.x = 0;
    this.velocity.x *= -1;
  } else if (this.location.x &gt; width) {
    this.location.x = width;
    this.velocity.x *= -1;
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        All this does not do anything because there are no forces applied to the balloon. This is where I struggled.
        <code>sketch.js</code> is behaving as the real world in this example and it is responsible for applying the
        forces onto the balloon. To start off I create variables <code>balloon</code>, <code>heliumRiseForce</code>,
        and <code>windIncrement</code> as global variables. <code>balloon</code> is the <code>Balloon</code> object
        described up to now, <code>heliumRiseForce</code> is the vector to simulate how fast the balloon should float
        up, and <code>windIncrement</code> is a counter to move through the <code>noise()</code> function. I than have
        functions <code>getWindForce()</code> to get the wind vector, <code>setup()</code>, and <code>draw()</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">var balloon;
var heliumRiseForce;
var windIncrement = 0;

function getWindForce() {
}

function setup() {
  let canvas = createCanvas(800, 800);
  canvas.parent("canvas");
  balloon = new Balloon();

  heliumRiseForce = createVector(0, -0.05);
}

function draw() {
    background('#dfdfdf');
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Note the <code>heliumRiseForce.y</code> is -0.05. Just like with values in this example, I just like the speed
        the balloon travels at this value. Before getting to the wind, I want to apply the helium rise to the balloon.
        This is done in the <code>draw()</code> function: apply the force, update the balloon, check the edges, and
        finally display the balloon.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  background('#dfdfdf');

  balloon.applyForce(heliumRiseForce);

  balloon.update();
  balloon.checkEdges();
  balloon.display();
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        This works perfectly to have the balloon hit the ceiling and bounce back. As a plus it bounces a smaller
        amount each time it hits which looks very realistic. So now the wind, and this is another place where I
        struggled. First, I want the wind applied <strong><em>while</em></strong> the user is
        <strong><em>holding</em></strong> the mouse button and it should be a gentle push, not a massive shove. The
        <code>getWindForce()</code> function uses the <code>windIncrement</code> variable to move through the
        <code>noise()</code> function and maps the noise value to somewhere between -1 and 1. A new vector is created
        using the mapped value in the x direction.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function getWindForce() {
  let xDirection = map(noise(windIncrement), 0, 1, -1, 1);
  return createVector(xDirection, 0);
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        This generates the wind but now it has to be applied. This happes in the <code>draw()</code> function along
        with the <code>heliumRiseForce</code>. I use the <code>mouseIsPressed</code> variable to check if the mouse is
        pressed, and if it is, I call <code>getWindForce()</code> to create a new wind vector apply it to the balloon,
        and increment the <code>windIncrement</code> to get a new value for wind next time.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  background('#dfdfdf');

  balloon.applyForce(heliumRiseForce);

  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    let wind = getWindForce();
    balloon.applyForce(wind);
    windIncrement += 0.1;
  }

  balloon.update();
  balloon.checkEdges();
  balloon.display();
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        This completes the exercise. The section below is me explaining where I went wrong as a beginner.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Did Wrong</h2>
    <p>
        As I said, I am new to P5 so the drawing loop is still foriegn to me. I actually go the balloon to float to
        the top and stop without any help, but I could not get the bounce. To me, I felt like the balloon was
        responsible for its own rise so I had the rising force within the balloon. But this meant I had no way to
        modify it from outside the balloon. I knew I had to reverse the velocity, but how do I get the balloon to rise
        again? Because the balloon was doing everything, rising, bouncing, checking edges, I didn't understand how to
        have the drawing loop could be used to move the balloon in different directions by applying a force in the same
        direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I saw the author was using <code>sketch.js</code> to apply the force to move the balloon, it all made
        sense. The draw loop is the physics engine in this example, it applies the rising force and the wind. So once
        the balloon hits the ceiling and reverses direction, the <code>draw()</code> function will apply the rising
        force so the balloon will slow downa and rise again. I also didn't know about the <code>mouseIsPressed</code>
        variable, I was trying to use the <code>mousePressed()</code> event which wasn't helping.
