    <h1>Exercise 2.3</h1>
    <p>
        Instead of objects bouncing off the edges of the wall, create an example in which an invisible force pushes
        back on the objects to keep them in the window. Can you weight the force according to how far the object is
        from an edge-i.e., the close it is, the stronger the force?
    </p>

    <div id="canvas"></div>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>
        <em>I do not know if this solution is correct</em>.  I am getting the behavior I expect but I'm not sure for
        some reason this is what the author intended.  Also, see <a href="#p_struggle">the struggle</a> for an
        overview of the difficulties I had with this.  I actually looked up how others have done this and then used
        that as inspiration for my solution.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted a solution where the force applied to the object scaled exponentially with how close the object is to
        the wall. To me this meant exponential decay using the formula
        $$
        y = a\left(1-b\right)^x
        $$
        where \(y\) is the magnitude of the force applied to the object, \(a\) is the maximum magnitude allowed, \(b\)
        is the rate of decay, and \(x\) is the distance away from the wall. The values I chose for \(a\) and \(b\) are
        5 and 0.025 so the formula I am using is
        $$
        y = 5\left(1-0.025\right)^x
        $$
        This produces the curve shown below.
    </p>

        <figcaption>The decay function used for the exercise.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
        As the object gets closer to the wall (0 in the graph above) the force calculated by the function gets larger,
        up to 5.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted this behavior when the object approached all 4 edges and the force has to be applied in the proper
        direction. To determine which direction the force needs to be applied, I decided to split the canvas dimension
        in two.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The area to the left of the middle would get a positive force</li>
        <li>The area to the right of the middle would get a negative force</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The illustration below demonstrates what I mean. There is no need to know the direction the object is moving
        and applying the opposite force. Instead, determine where the object is in relation to where you want it to be
        and apply a force to get it there.  I want the objects to be pushed to the middle, so anything to the left of
        middle needs a positive force to move it right, and anything right of middle needs a negative force to move it
        left.  In the illustration below, the canvas is 800 by 800, so the middle is 400.
    </p>

    <p>
    <figure>
        <img width="800" src="./img/force-direction.svg" alt="The force directions" />
        <figcaption>The force is applied based on where the object is, rather than where it is traveling.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This approach works in both the x and y direction and can be generalized.  I created a function
        <code>exponentialDecay()</code> to accept an object's location and the size of the canvas which returns the
        magnitude of the force to apply.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">/**
* Returns the force value for a location based on how close it is to the specified edge 
* dimension.
* 
* @param {number} location - The location to calculate the force for.
* @param {number} edge - The maximum value for the edge to check.
* @returns {number} A number representing the strength of the force to apply.
*/
function exponentailDecay(location, edge) {
  let dNorm = 0;
  let direction = 1;

  if (location &lt;= edge / 2) {
    // the location is to the left of the middle, the location is how close it os to the edge
    dNorm = location;
  } else {
    // the location is to the right of the middle, calculate how close it is to the edge by 
    // subtracting from the edge value
    dNorm = edge - location;

    // the returning force must push to the left
    direction = -1;
 }

 // using random values for the starting and decay values.
 let force = 5 * Math.pow(1 - 0.025, dNorm)
 return force * direction;
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        The variable <code>dNorm</code> is the distance from the edge to the object and <code>direction</code> will be
        used to switch the direction of the force.  When the location is to the left of the middle
    </p>
    
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">if (location &lt;= edge / 2)</code></pre>
    
    <p>
        Than the location itself is how close the object is to the edge because the edge is at 0.  But when the
        location is greater than the middle, to get the distance (<code>dNorm</code>) subtract the object's location
        from the edge.  Since the force has to push back to the middle and the object is to the right, the
        <code>direction</code> is set to -1 so the force can be reversed before the function exits.
    </p>

    <p>
        A call to the <code>exponentailDecay()</code> function needs to be done for both the x and y parts of the force
        vector and the returned values are used to create the force.  The force is applied along with the wind and
        gravity like in the example.  This is all in sketch.js.      
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function draw() {
  background('#dfdfdf');

  let leftWind = createVector(0.01, 0);
  let gravity = createVector(0, 0.1);

  for (let i = 0; i &lt; movers.length; i++) {
    let xForce = exponentailDecay(movers[i].location.x, width);
    let yForce = exponentailDecay(movers[i].location.y, height);
    let edgeForce = createVector(xForce, yForce);

    movers[i].applyForce(edgeForce);
    movers[i].applyForce(leftWind);
    movers[i].applyForce(gravity);
    movers[i].update();
    movers[i].display();
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        I also changed how the objects are created.  The object's mass, x location, and y location are randomized so
        they all start at a random location.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function setup() {
  let canvas = createCanvas(800, 800);
  canvas.parent("canvas");

  movers = new Array(100);

  for (let i = 0; i < movers.length; i++) {
    movers[i] = new Mover(random(0.1, 5), random(0, width), random(0, height));
  }

  p = select("#output");
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        To prove out this works, I also removed the <code>checkEdges()</code> call and even removed the function from
        the <code>Mover</code> class.
    </p>

    <h1 id="p_struggle">The Struggle</h1>
    <p>
        To me, the hardest part of this exercise was determining how to scale the force with how close the object is to
        the wall. The other difficult part was determining which direction the object was moving. I tried to do this
        on my own for a few days not making a lot of progress and eventually came acros
        <a href="https://observablehq.com/@ajur/the-nature-of-code-2-forces" target="_blank">this page</a> by Adam
        Jurczyk. In Adam's solution there is a use of the formulas
    </p>

    <pre>xNorm = location.x / width;
yNorm = location.y / height;</pre>

    <p>
        Adam than subtracts these values from 0.5 for the force vector to apply
    </p>

    <pre>createVector(0.5 - xNorm, 0.5 - yNorm);</pre>

    <p>
        I didn't understand this at first until I realized what is going on. In short, the formulas convert the object
        location from the canvas location to a value between 0 and 1 (almost like a percentage). For example, if the
        <code>width</code> is 800 and <code>location.x</code> is 643, <code>xNorm</code> is calculated as 643 / 800
        which is 0.80375; about 80% of the way across the canvas. If the value is greater than 0.5, the object is
        closer to the right edge than the left and needs a negative force in the x direction. That's why the value is
        subtracted from 0.5. Using the same example again 0.5 - 0.80375 = -0.30375; a negative value. When the force
        is created with this value it will push the object to the left. In short, the formulas normalize the location
        and the subtraction from 0.5 automatically creates a force in the right direction. It also scales with how
        close the object is to the edges. The values closer to the edges will have a higher value after the subtraction
        versus the values closer to the middle.
    </p>

    <p>
        But this is a linear scale and I want an exponential scale, that's why I didn't use this.  Instead the
        realization that it's more important to know where the object is rather than where it's going is what I took
        from Adam's solution and applied it to my formula.
