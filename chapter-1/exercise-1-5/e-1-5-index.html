  <title>Exercise 1.5</title>

  <h1>Exercise 1.5</h1>
  <p>
    Create a simulation of a car (or runner) that accelerates when yo press the up key and brakes when you press the
    down key.
  </p>

  <div id="canvas"></div>
  <p id="output"></p>
  <h1>Solution</h1>
  <p>
    A few things to note on how I understand the exercise
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The canvas is a simulation with a real worl object in it. In this case I am treating the object like a car.
    </li>
    <li>
      The car can move only in the forward direction and cannot turn or change gears. It can't go into
      reverse for example or turn left or right.
    </li>
    <li>The speed of the car is constant. This means that if no keys are pressed the speed will not change.</li>
    <li>
      Pressing the up key increases the speed of the car by a constant value. For example, press the up key once
      and it adds 1 to the speed. Press it again it will add 1 to the speed again.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pressing the down key has the same effect, but it decreases the speed of the car. The constant to increase
      and decrease the speed is the same.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remoing all speed means the car is stopped (speed = 0). It is not possible to have a negative speed or to
      have the car move backwards.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Setting up the environment I created a class <code>Car</code>. This class represents the object moving in the
    canvas and follows the rules above. Following OOP practices, I do not want my car to know anything about reading
    keyboard input; it only knows how to accelerate, decelerate, update itself, and show itself. For that it has
    functions <code>accelerate()</code>, <code>decelerate()</code>, <code>update()</code>, and <code>show()</code>.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">class Car {
  constructor() { /* see above */ }

  accelerate() { }

  decelerate() { }

  update() { }

  show() { }
}</code></pre>
  <p>
    The car has vectors <code>location</code> to track the current locaiton, <code>velocity</code> to track the
    speed, and <code>acceleration</code> to add and remove speed. I also added a top speed so the car can't go out
    of control, and a stop speed. The stop speed is 0 and I'll explain later why it's needed. I am also keeping
    track of what direction the car is moving, more on that later.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">constructor() {
  this.location = createVector(width / 2, height / 2);
  this.velocity = createVector(0, 0);
  this.acceleration = createVector(0, -0.1);

  this.topSpeed = 10;
  this.stopSpeed = 0;

  this.direction = "";
  this.oldDirection = "";
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    One of my rules is the car cannot go backwards, but what does that mean in this simulation? The
    <code>velocity</code> vector starts at 0 and the <code>acceleration</code> vector is changing
    only the y direction. So when <code>acceleration</code> is added to <code>velocity</code>, the only change
    will be to <code>velocity</code>'s y value. The <code>acceleration</code> adds a negative value to
    <code>velocity</code> and in p5js this is moving from bottom of the canvas to the top. In this simulation,
    <em>adding acceleration to velocity will move the car up the canvas</em>; this is the forward direction.
    Subtracting <code>acceleration</code> from <code>velocity</code> will move the car down the canvas; this is the
    backwoard direction. However, <code>acceleration</code> is a constant, so it may take multiple decelerations to
    actually move down the screen. For example, let's say the user pressed the up key 5 times. The values in the
    <code>velocity</code> vector are &lt;0, -0.5&gt; and the car is moving up the screen. Now the user presses the
    down key once, the <code>velocity</code> vector is now &lt;0, -0.4&gt;, still moving up the screen (y is still
    negative). The user will have to press the down key more times than the up key to have the car change
    direction. But if the user continues to press the down key, the car will move faster and faster down the
    screen because <code>velocity</code>'s magnitude will continue to get larger and larger (the y value will
    continue to get larger and larger) just in the wrong direction. This is not allowed. The car should come to
    a stop if the user presses the down key to a point where the car changes direction from moving up the screen to
    moving down the screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where the <code>direction</code> and <code>oldDirection</code> properties are used. After either
    accelerating or decelerating, the car has to check which direction it's heading. I use <code>heading()</code>
    function to check the direction of the <code>velocity</code> vector. <code>oldDirection</code> is the
    direction <em>prior</em> to the key press and <code>direction</code> is the new direction. If
    <code>oldDirection</code> and <code>direction</code> are not the same, it means the car changed direction. This
    is implemented in the <code>updateDirection()</code> function.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">updateDirection() {
  this.oldDirection = this.direction;

  if (this.velocity.heading() > 0) {
    this.direction = "DOWN";
  } else {
    this.direction = "UP";
  }
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    After either accelerating or decelerating a call is made to <code>updateDirection</code>. This is not
    that important when accelerating but it is important during deceleration. If during deceleration the two
    directions don't match, that means the user is trying to go backwards. When this happens I set the magnitude of
    the velocity to <code>stopSpeed</code>, which is 0. This basically stops the car but it doesn not prevent the
    user from moving backwards if they continue to press the down key because the two directions will match on the
    next key press. I only decelerate if <code>velocity</code>'s magnitude is greater than 0. There is no point
    of decelerating if the speed is already at 0.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">decelerate() {
  if (this.velocity.mag() > 0) {
    this.velocity.sub(this.acceleration);
    this.updateDirection();

    if (this.direction != this.oldDirection) {
      this.velocity.setMag(this.stopSpeed);
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    During acceleration, I add the <code>acceleration</code> vector to <code>velocity</code> and limit the
    <code>velocity</code> vector to the value in <code>topSpeed</code>. This way the car will not move too quickly.
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-javascript">accelerate() {
  this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);
  this.velocity.limit(this.topSpeed);
  this.updateDirection();
}</code></pre>

  <p>
    Since the <code>Car</code> does not handle user input, that is done in <code>sketch.js</code>.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">var c;
var p;

function setup() {
  let canvas = createCanvas(800, 800);
  canvas.parent("canvas");

  background(90);

  c = new Car();
  p = select("#output");

}

/**
 * Check which key is pressed and have the Mover react.
 */
function keyPressed() {
  if (keyCode === UP_ARROW) {
    c.accelerate();
  } else if (keyCode === DOWN_ARROW) {
    c.decelerate();
  }
}

function draw() {
  background(90);
  c.update();
  c.show();
  p.html("Speed: " + c.velocity.mag());
}</code></pre>
